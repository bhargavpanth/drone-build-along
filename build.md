# Building the quad

This post is going to be longer than the previous ones. I will be updating this repo in parts as and when I find the time after every stage of the build.

Get the frame ready. The frame itself comes with several different screws and the frame manufacturer provides one or maybe two extra pieces. So, you will almost never run out of it, unless you don't organise it well. The instruction manual takes a little time to understand, so please spend those few minutes and oragnise the screws, washers and other parts well in advance.

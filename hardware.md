# Hardware components to buy

For a newbie, getting started with building a quad might be slightly overwhelming. And frankly, a bit daunting if this is your first hardware project. The list below are all the hardware components you'll need to get started

- [Emax ECO 2207 2400kv](http://bit.ly/2pwsXdk) - x4
- [iFlight SL5](http://bit.ly/2kBCNZz) - x1
- [RushFPV Tiny Tank](http://bit.ly/38KFhbo) - x1
- [Rush Antenna](http://bit.ly/2SQ0ETp) - x1
- [Mamba F405 stack](https://bit.ly/3eoL8qT) - x1
- [Racer Nano](http://bit.ly/2L6Pzd8) - x1
- [XT60](http://bit.ly/2T6oQQl) - x1 (You don't need an extra XT60 Mamba provides you with one. Since these parts are cheap, it might make sense for you to buy them in bulk)
- [Xm+ Receiver](http://bit.ly/2Kamywh) - x1
- [X9-Lite Transceiver](https://bit.ly/2JtLJMm)
- [LiPo battery](https://amzn.to/34XpdDV) - I went with these and they are working really well so far
- [LiPo balance charger](https://amzn.to/3oZPBVF) - Really important for charging and discharing your LiPo
- [LiPo bag](https://amzn.to/3oZPBVF) - Please use this when charging/discharging your LiPo
- [18650 battery](https://amzn.to/3jZJRre) - Required for the Transceiver
- [Mamba LED strips](https://bit.ly/3evlrEX) - x1 (optional)
- Please note that the Lipo balance charger does not come with an adapter. You will have to buy one of your own. I use a 12V 6A charging adapter and it does the work. Please be careful, do not buy ones that does not specify the output voltage and amps clearly.

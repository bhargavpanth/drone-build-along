# Getting ready for the build

For anyone who has never soldered before, you might be nervous (at least I was, even though this wasn't my first time soldering). When you have all the components, the sheer volume of the components will overwhelm you. A lot of wires, screws, washers and plastic pieces to prep up.

Before you get started on the build, I would advice you to prep up your wire. What does it mean? It means, cut the ends of the wires (if they aren't already) and apply a little bit of solder to it. That way the strains of metal (the core of the wire) does not brush out and mess up your solder.

Another important thing that I would advice anyone starting with the project is to start bottom up. You may have a preference on how you want to start your build, but I found building the base of the frame and soldering on the motor wires was the best way.

When you cut the wires for adjusting the length for your motors, PLEASE DO NOT cut it too close to the motor. If by chance you pull out one of them, it is almost impossible to put it back together (unless you know how they are put together). I made that mistake and I rendered one of my motors useless. I had to wait for another month and a half to get some spares.

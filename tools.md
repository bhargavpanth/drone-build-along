# Tools

This is probably the most frustrating part of this project. Buying the right tools for the job. At the least, you will need the following set of tools -

- [Hex screwdrivers](https://bit.ly/3jXjwKs) - 0.2 is the most useful for this build. But I suggest you buy the set
- [PVC tape]() - pick them up form a nearby hardware store
- [Wire cutter]() - pick them up from a nearby hardware store
- [Soldering iron]() - pick them up from a nearby hardware store
- [Soldering flux]() - pick them up from a nearby hardware store
- [Soldering lead]() - pick them up from a nearby hardware store

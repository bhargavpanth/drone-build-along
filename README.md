# Drone build along

I have am documenting my jouney of building a quadcopter step by step. Before I begin, I must acknowldge DroneMesh for his incredible tutorials on building a budget FPV drone. As a relatively inexperienced drone builder such as myself, I found his tutorials absolutely fantastic. And this is only a journal for anyone else who wants to build one themselves.

Like I mentioned, I am not experienced with building drones. And this is my first drone/quadcopter project. This repo is only a list of mistakes that I made and how to avoid them. I will add in as many pictures and videos as I possible can to make it as informative as possible. But if you want any more clarifications, feel free to open an issue and I will update the documents as required.

As a gesture of good-will to DroneMesh, I will leave his affiliate links in here. Please help support his work by using the links in this repo.
